# dx_entity (Resource)

Manages a DX Entity. Entities represent items in your software catalog (e.g., services, APIs, domains).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Create a service entity with properties, relations, and aliases
resource "dx_entity" "payment_service" {
  identifier     = "payment-service"
  type           = "service"
  name           = "Payment Service"
  description    = "Core payment processing service handling all payment transactions"
  owner_team_ids = ["MzI1NTk"]
  owner_user_ids = ["MQ"]
  domain         = "payments"

  properties = {
    service_tier      = "Tier-1"
    language          = "[\"Go\", \"Python\"]"
    slack_channel_url = "https://slack.com/channels/payment-service"
    architecture      = "microservices"
    deployment_env    = "[\"production\", \"staging\"]"
  }

  relations = {
    consumesAPI = ["auth-service", "notification-service"]
    dependsOn   = ["payment-db", "redis-cache"]
  }

  aliases = {
    github_repo = [
      {
        identifier = "1234567890"
        name       = "company/payment-service"
        url        = "https://github.com/company/payment-service"
      }
    ]
    pagerduty_service = [
      {
        identifier = "PD12345"
        name       = "Payment Service"
        url        = "https://company.pagerduty.com/services/PD12345"
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Example 2: Create an API entity with minimal configuration
resource "dx_entity" "user_api" {
  identifier     = "user-api"
  type           = "api"
  name           = "User Management API"
  description    = "RESTful API for user management operations"
  owner_team_ids = ["MzI1NTk"]
  domain         = "platform"

  properties = {
    api_version   = "v2"
    protocol      = "REST"
    documentation = "https://api.company.com/docs/user-api"
    rate_limit    = "1000/hour"
  }

  relations = {
    providesAPI = ["user-service"]
    usesData    = ["user-database"]
  }

  aliases = {
    openapi_spec = [
      {
        identifier = "user-api-v2"
        name       = "User API OpenAPI Spec"
        url        = "https://api.company.com/openapi/user-api.yaml"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `type` (String) The identifier of the entity type (e.g., 'service', 'api', 'domain').

### Optional

- `aliases` (Map of List of Object) Key-value pairs of aliases assigned to the entity. Keys are alias types (e.g., 'github_repo'), values are arrays of alias objects with 'identifier' (required) field.

- `name` (String) Display name for the entity.
- `owner_team_ids` (List of String) Array of owner team IDs assigned to the entity.
- `owner_user_ids` (List of String) Array of owner user IDs assigned to the entity.
- `properties` (Dynamic) Key-value pairs of entity properties and their values. Values can be strings, numbers, null, objects, or lists of any of those types.
- `relations` (Map of List of String) Key-value pairs of relations and their associated entity identifiers. Keys are relation types (e.g., 'service-consumes-api'), values are arrays of entity identifiers.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the entity was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the entity (same as 'identifier').
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the entity was last updated.
